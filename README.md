# Dofi (Dotfile Manager)

Enables you to manage your dotfiles in a separate git-repository and synchronize them with your home directory.

It is heavily inspired by [`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) but tries to simplify the workflow by focusing solely on the use-case of managing dotfiles.

## Install

```bash
just install
```
